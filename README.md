# tamagotchi-mp
General Assembly Tamagotchi Mini Project
We were instructed to build a game showcasing our front-end web development skills and create a "living" pet.
In this game, we were to:
* Display a character of our choice on the screen to represent our pet.
* Display the following metrics for our pet:
  Hunger (1-10 scale) 
  Sleepiness (1-10 scale)
  Boredom (1-10 scale)
  Age
* Add buttons to the screen to feed our pet, turn off the lights, and play with them.
* Add the ability to name our pet.
* Style the page.
* Increase our pet's age every x minutes/seconds
* Increase our pet's Hunger, Sleepiness, and Bored metrics on an interval of our choosing.
* Our pet should die if Hunger, Boredom, or Sleepiness hits 10.
* Morph our pet at certain ages.
* Animate our pet across the screen while it's alive.
